# Project-Phase-2
# Time Series Forecasting of Sales Data using Machine Learning

## About
Time series forecasting of sales data using machine learning is a project aimed at leveraging advanced algorithms to predict future sales trends based on historical data. This project seeks to uncover patterns and seasonality within the sales data, allowing businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and revenue projections. Through accurate forecasting, businesses can optimize their strategies, minimize risks, and capitalize on opportunities in an ever-evolving market landscape.

Time Series Decompose:
The trend represents long-term movements, seasonality reflects cyclic patterns, and the remainder accounts for residual variation. 
This analysis aids in understanding sales patterns, facilitating tasks like forecasting and anomaly detection.

## Results 
Utilizing historical sales data, alongside additional store and external factors, facilitated a thorough understanding of sales patterns and trends.
Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, K Neighbors, XGBoost, and Custom Deep Learning Neural Network were trained and evaluated for their efficacy in sales prediction.
The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy among the evaluated models, achieving a commendable prediction accuracy of 97.89%.
